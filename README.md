# Terminator configuration

I use terminator as second choice (mostly at work), when the system doesn't provide i3 + xterm, but a different window manager.

Place 'config' file in ~/.config/terminator/config

## Commands

The terminator commands are taken from my i3 configuration:

* Alt+-     splits vertically
* Alt+\     splits horizontally
* Alt+q     closes terminal
* Alt+Left  moves left
* Alt+Right moves right
* Alt+Up    moves up
* Alt+Down  moves down
* Alt+f     zoomes current terminal

## Colors

The colors are taken from my xterm configuration.
